# media_bias_analysis
This study analyzes media bias using the Allsides dataset, which includes 442 entries detailing news channels, bias categories, votes, agreement counts, agree ratios, sentiment levels, and article links. The main objectives are to examine the distribution of media bias, agreement trends, agree ratios, and sentiment patterns. Methodologically, the study involves computing and visualizing bias distribution, conducting an agreement analysis to assess votes and agreement counts, calculating mean agree ratios, and performing a sentiment distribution analysis. Key findings reveal varied distributions of media bias, significant differences in agreement patterns, notable variations in mean agree ratios, and diverse sentiment patterns across bias categories. These results provide insights into how media outlets align with specific biases and how audience agreement and sentiment differ among these biases. The study's implications highlight the importance of understanding media bias and its impact on public perception, contributing valuable insights for future research in this field
